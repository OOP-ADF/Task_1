# Task_1
OOP ADF Task 1 : Introduction to Java
> This exercise is intended to allow students to practice basic Java programming  <br>
> and try the basic functionality of GitHub (Fork, CLone, Commit, Push, Pull Request)

* There are 3 exercises which you must complete in each respective file
  * PrimeNumber.java
  * IndexPoint.java
  * TemperatureConvert.java
  
* You should write down your identity (Name, Student ID, Class) on the top of each file
  * fail to do so ==> point = 0

## PrimeNumber.java
* write a java program that ask user an input of integer and determine whether the number is prime or not
* write the output


## IndexPoint.java
* write a java program that ask user 3 inputs of number that represent mid-term score (UTS), end-term score (UAS), and Quiz score
* calculate the final score of 35% mid-term score, 40% end-term score, and 25% Quiz score
* determine the grade of the score using these rules, and write the output grade

| score | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| 85-100 | excellent |
| 75-84 | very good |
| 65-74 | good |
| 50-64 | accepted |
| 49-0 | failed |

## TemperatureConvert.java
* write a java program that ask user an input of number that represent a temperature in celcius degrees from
* ask the user the choices to convert the temperature to Reamur degrees from, Fahrenheit degrees from, or Kelvin
* write the output
* ask the user if he/she wants to convert the number to another degrees from
